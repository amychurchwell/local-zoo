# LocalZoo
#### January 19, 2018. Amy Churchwell, _Epicodus Student._

An application to track animals at a local zoo.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.4.

## Requirements

Project objectives.

### Example Entry

```
---------
Species: "Arctic Fox"
Name: "Moon"
Age: 2
Diet: "Carnivore"
Location: "Northern Trail"
Caretakers: 5
Sex: "Female"
Likes: "Cool shade"
Dislikes: "Loud noises"
---------
```

### User Requirements

- [ ] I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.

- [ ] I want to view a list of animals I have logged.

- [ ] I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).

- [ ] I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.

(FURTHER EXPLORATION NOT INCLUDED)

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Application uses a model to organize data.

- [ ] Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state. (Clear code presentation, error free, basic styling, complete README, thoughtful UI, etc.)

- [ ] README contains details on functionality you'd include in the future, given the opportunity.

- [ ] Required functionality was in place by the Friday deadline.

- [ ] Project demonstrates understanding of week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

- [ ] Separate components are used for creating and editing instances of a model and for viewing a list of instances.

- [ ] Users can successfully create and edit instances of a model, as well as view a list of all instances.

- [ ] TypeScript is used throughout application; including variable data types.

- [ ] The list of instances can be filtered using a pipe.


## Future Functionality
What I would include in the future, given the opportunity.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
