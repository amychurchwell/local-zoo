```

### User Requirements

- [x] I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.

- [x] I want to view a list of animals I have logged.

- [ ] I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (2 years of age and older).

- [x] I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.

### Known Bugs

* Pipe is not displaying filtered results through drop-down search menu.

## Future Functionality

What I would include in the future, given the opportunity.

* Of course, the pipe bug would be fixed.
* Worker schedules.
* I would include add a chores element. Every animal would have a list of everyday required tasks. Assign workers to those tasks.
* A feeding schedule. Assign workers to those tasks.
